# PyCUDAShieldTablet

This is a nascent repository for instructions on how to get PyCUDA running on the NVIDIA Shield Tablet (and possibly Shield Tablet K1) using Termux (by Fredrik Fornwall).

**STATUS:** Pycuda works on google Pixel C running Android Nougat 7.0.1 with few limitations. There is a somewhat elaborate installation process for getting nvcc and CUDA 7.0 runnung. A description will follow.
